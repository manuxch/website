title: 'Effect of the trabecular bone microstructure on measuring its thermal conductivity:
  A computer modeling-based study'
volume: '77'
---
The objective of this work is to quantify the relation between the value of the effective thermal conductivity of trabecular bone and its microstructure and marrow content. The thermal conductivity of twenty bovine trabecular bone samples was measured prior to and after defatting at 37, 47, and 57&#8239;&#176;C. Computer models were built including the microstructure geometry and the gap between the tissue and measurement probe. The thermal conductivity (k) measured was 0.39&#8239;&#177;&#8239;0.06 W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1 at 37&#8239;&#176;C, with a temperature dependence of +&#8239;0.2
