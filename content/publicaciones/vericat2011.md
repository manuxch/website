title: Genetic algorithm for the pair distribution function of the electron gas
volume: '3'
---
The pair distribution function of the electron gas is calculated using a parameterized generalization of hypernetted chain approximation with the parameters being obtained by optimizing the system energy with a genetic algorithm. The functions so obtained are compared with Monte Carlo simulations performed by other authors in its variational and diffusion versions showing a very good agreement especially with the diffusion Monte Carlo results.
