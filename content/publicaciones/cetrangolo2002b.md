title: Limitations for Efficiency within the Beef Agrifood Chain in Argentina
---
In this contribution we present a competitiveness study of the beef agrifood chain in Argentina. This sector is one of the most important within the national economy. However, its participation in the international market has been decreasing due to its own efficiency limitations and to external factors as well. We have performed a netchain analysis by identifying the main chain actors and mechanisms of interaction among them. From this analysis, a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) analysis was made for evaluating chain performance. Finally, a quantitative measure of competitiveness level was obtained in comparison with main competitors through the evaluation of the competitive profile matrix.
