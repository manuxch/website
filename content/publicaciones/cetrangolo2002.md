title: Limitations for competitiveness in Argentinian sunflower agrifood chain
volume: '1'

Argentina is today the first sunflower oil producer and exporter. Its competitiveness relies on being highly efficient in the primary production and industrialization stages. However, this sector is threatened by several implemented mechanisms that distorted the international market. This paper presents an updated overview of Argentinean sunflower agrifood chain situation, describing primary production, industry, commercialization and main mechanisms that limit its competitiveness.
